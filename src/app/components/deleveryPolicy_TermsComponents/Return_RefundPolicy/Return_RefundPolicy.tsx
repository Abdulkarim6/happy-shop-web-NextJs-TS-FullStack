          <CardDescription className="text-base text-black">
            If your product is eligible for a refund, you can choose to refund
            via exchange courier. Once we have received your product (2-3
            working days after the customer has initiated return delivery) and
            it has undergone quality control (1-2 working days), the expected
            refund processing window is 7 working days.
            <br /> <br />
            Sometimes due to unwanted issues and transportation delays, the
            refund process may take a bit longer than the expected window.
            <br /> <br />
            That&apos;s it! We hope you enjoy shopping with HappyShop!
